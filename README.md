# Facial Recognition System with Anti-spoofing measures and Liveness Detection Models.
* Experimentation
* System Overview
## Experimenation
![Expermimentation](https://github.com/Ahmed-Rushdi/liveness_system/tree/master/Trainig_preprocessing_misc)
 with the different liveness detection models in [1], [2], [3] and Volumetric CNN.

## System Overview

We combine prompt-based authentication with liveness detection in a ![client](https://github.com/Ahmed-Rushdi/liveness_system/tree/master/Client)-![server](https://github.com/Ahmed-Rushdi/liveness_system/tree/master/server) environment.

Prompts are {'left', 'right', 'smile'}
